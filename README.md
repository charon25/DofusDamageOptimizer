# Dofus Damage Optimizer

This program is designed to help determine to best combinations of spells to use in each turn in the [Dofus MMORPG](https://www.dofus.com/en).

It can handle multiple stats pages, spells and spell sets, as well as multiple conditions for the damage computations, in order to give the most freedom possible.

It runs on a Python 3 console (developed on 3.9.10, probably work for older versions) and does not require any external package. So to run it, just use `python main.py` in the python scripts folder.

## Commands

Every `<name>` parameter in the commands below should not contains spaces and is unique for each type of commands.

### General

 - `s` : save everything (automatically done after most actions)
 - `i` : get informations on current state (TODO)
 - `def [[<parameter> <value>] ...]` : define default options for the damage computations (the parameters are described in the "Parameters" section)
 - `h` : help
 - `q` : quit

### Stats-related

 - `st new <name>` : create a new stats page and prompt the user for all the required informations
 - `st rm <name> ` : delete a stats page
 - `st mod <name>` : modify a stats page (prompt the user for all the changes)
 - `st ls` : list all the currently available stats pages
 - `st show <name>` : show more details on the specified stats pages

### Spells-related

 - `sp new <name>` : create a new spell and prompt the user for all the required informations
 - `sp rm <name> ` : delete a spell
 - `sp mod <name>` : modify a spell (prompt the user for all the changes)
 - `sp ls` : list all the currently available spells
 - `sp show <name>` : show more details on the specified spell
 - `sp dmg|d <spell_name> [[<parameter> <value>] ...]` : compute and show the detailed damages of a spell (the parameters are described in the "Parameters" section)

### Spell sets-related

 - `ss new <name>` : creates a new spell set
 - `ss rm <name> ` : deletes a spell set
 - `ss add <spell_set_name> <spell_name>` : add the specified spell to the spell set
 - `ss del <spell_set_name> <spell_name>` : remove the specified spell from the spell set
 - `ss ls` : lists all the currently available spell sets
 - `ss show <name>` : shows more details on the specified spell set

### Damage-related

The command to get the best combination of spells for given constraints is : 
`dmg <spell_set_name> [[<param> <value>] ...]`
The parameters are described in the "Parameters" section.

### Parameters

The possible parameters for every command that requires it are :
 - `-s` (or `-stats`) followed by as many stats page short name as wanted : the stats page to use for the computations ;
 - `-pa` followed by a positive integer : the maximum number of AP (*action point*) to use ;
 - `-po` followed by a non negative integer : the exact range to the enemy ;
 - `-pomin` (or `-minpo`) followed by a non negative integer : the minimum range to the enemy ;
 - `-pomax` (or `-maxpo`) followed by a non negative integer : the maximum range to the enemy (note that maximum should be >= minimum) ;
 - `-t` (or `-type`) followed by one of `mono`, `multi`, `versa` : indicates if the computation takes into account the number of uses per target ('mono'), the number of uses per turn ('multi') or only one time each spell ('versa') ;
 - `-r` (or `-res`, `-resistances`) followed by five integers (may be negative) : indicates the resistances of the enemy to each element (in order : NEUTRAL, EARTH, FIRE, WATER, AIR) ;
 - `-d` (or `-distance`) followed by one of `melee`, `range` : indicates if the damage computations should take into account RANGE or MELEE damages ;
 - `-v` (or `-vulne`, `-vulnerability`) followed by one integer (may be negative) : indicate the bonus (or reduced) damages dealt because of vulnerability or damage reduction (independant from resistances).


## Examples of damages computation

```
>>> dmg base base
Maximum average damages (PA = 11 ; PO = 1 - 10 ; type = mono) is : 1278

Using :
 - Ether (300 dmg)
 - Ether (300 dmg)
 - Morph (air) (408 dmg)
 - Ouragan (270 dmg)
```
Here, there are both a spell set named `base` and a stats page named `base`.

With parameters :
```
>>> dmg base base po 8 t multi
Maximum average damages (PA = 11 ; PO = 8 - 8 ; type = multi) is : 1287

Using :
 - Lame Astrale (439 dmg)
 - Lame Astrale (439 dmg)
 - Morph (air) (408 dmg)
```

With an additional stats page :
```
>>> dmg base base po 8 t versa s turquoise
Maximum average damages (PA = 11 ; PO = 8 - 8 ; type = versa) is : 1324

Using :
 - ComÃ¨te (425 dmg)
 - Lame Astrale (464 dmg)
 - Morph (air) (433 dmg)
```

Calculating only one spell damages :
```
>>> sp d tison base
Damages of the spell Tison:

Individual characteristics:
 - INTELLIGENCE: 102 - 115 (118 - 131)
 - AGILITY: 327 - 370 (380 - 423)

Total damages:   429 - 485 (498 - 554)
Average damages: 457 (526) => 468 with 16 % crit chance
```
